# Book Web Application

Welcome to the **Book Web Application**! This project allows users to **register**, **borrow books**, **add new books**, and **view a list of all books**. It's built to demonstrate how a simple book management system can be implemented using Java servlet for the backend and MySQL for the database. It is focusing on applying and improving my Java and Servlet knowledge.

## Features

- **User Registration**: New users can register by providing their details, enabling them to borrow books from the system.

- **Add New Books**: Admin users can add new books to the system, making them available for others to borrow.
  
  ![add](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5071e07b-f996-405c-9e48-ca297c7e76bc)

- **View Book List**: Users can view a complete list of all the books available in the system.
  
  ![list](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07419868-4aa3-4f7c-8273-a58546adbf65)
